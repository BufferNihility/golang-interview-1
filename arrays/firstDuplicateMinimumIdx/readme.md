# First Duplicate Minimum Index

## Problem Statement
Given an array a that contains only numbers in the range from 1 to a.length, find the first duplicate number for which the second occurrence has the minimal index. 
In other words, if there are more than 1 duplicated numbers, return the number for which the second occurrence has a smaller index than the second occurrence of the other number does. If there are no such elements, return -1.

Examples:
For the array [1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3], the algorithm should output 3.  There are three duplicates, and the index of the second duplicate of the number 3 occurs before the second duplicate of the other numbers.
