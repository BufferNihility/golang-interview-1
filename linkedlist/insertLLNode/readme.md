# insertLLNode

## Problem Statement
Implement an insert LLNode operation to a linked list in a pointed language which does not use conditionals
This is an iteration over the removeLLNode method mentioned in a talk on code taste linus torvalds did that was highlighted in this article: https://grisha.org/blog/2013/04/02/linus-on-understanding-pointers/

## Analysis
- This algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity where n is the length of the linked list
