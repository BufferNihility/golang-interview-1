# Length of Longest Substring

## Problem Statement
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:

Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

## Things Learned

## Questions to Ask from Problem Statement
- Are there any memory constraints that are imposed on the algorithm?
- Can we assume all strings are lowercase letters, or will there be capital letters too?
- If a character in the substring is found to repeat, do we count that character as the beginning of the new substring?
