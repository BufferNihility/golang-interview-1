## Description
A repo of interview questions written by a guy who had to teach himself


## How to start learning this stuff by yourself
- LEARN BY CATEGORY
In the past, I chose leetcode / interview topics at random to learn.
Because of this, I never felt confident enough in any particular topic.
When you focus on a topic, you gain the knowledge required to recognize the problem in context, know how to start solving it AND 
start to know how the answer code should be constructed.

If you choose questions haphazardly and haven't solved any similar questions before you will probably not be able to start.
Take a few (I chose around 5) questions on each new topic you learn and see the pattern of solution work in multiple contexts.

- Review
After completing a few questions on each topic, make sure you find some way to review.

I like to use a Spaced Repetition System to store my mistakes and create QA pairs of intuitions I've gained through solving multiple problems.

I also signed up to a couple newletters that ping me each week / day with questions I can choose to solve when I have time.

This might seem like it violates the "don't choose random question to study" rule, but I think that after you are fairly familiar a few topics,
some type of review mechanism will work to refresh these in your head from time to time.
